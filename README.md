## 🎯 Introduction
Welcome to our **Hyper-Personalized Financial Recommendation System** —an AI-powered solution designed to deliver tailored financial product suggestions based on customer profiles, transaction history, and social media sentiment.

Our system leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to:

✅ *Recommend* the most suitable financial products (loans, investments, credit cards)

✅ *Assess risk profiles* (High/Medium/Low) for better decision-making

✅ *Detect biases* in recommendations to ensure fairness

✅ *Explain* recommendations in natural language for transparency

# ✨ Key Features

- **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**
  - Combines Gradient Boosting with Transformer embeddings
  - Processes both structured and unstructured data
- **Risk Assessment**
  - Calculates personalized risk profiles (High/Medium/Low)
- **Bias Detection**
  - Monitors fairness across protected attributes
- **Explainable AI**
  - Provides natural language explanations for recommendations

## 💡 Inspiration
What inspired you to create this project? Describe the problem you're solving.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Our hyper-personalized recommendation system analyzes customer profiles, transaction histories, and social media sentiment to:

Suggest tailored financial products (loans, investments, credit cards)

Calculate individual risk profiles (High/Medium/Low)

Detect potential biases in recommendations

Provide natural language explanations for each suggestion

Key features:

Processes both structured (income, age) and unstructured data (social media posts)

Combines traditional ML with transformer-based embeddings

Adapts to severe class imbalances in the data

Delivers API endpoints for easy integration

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Core Architecture
1. Data Pipeline

 - Automated loading/cleaning of multiple data sources

 - Advanced feature engineering (numeric, categorical, text)

 - Sentiment analysis integration

2. Hybrid Recommendation Engine
```sh
graph TD
  A[Customer Data] --> B[Feature Engineering]
  B --> C[Gradient Boosting Classifier]
  A --> D[Text Embeddings]
  D --> C
  C --> E[Calibration]
  E --> F[Recommendations]
```
3. Fairness Monitoring

 - Continuous bias detection

 - Protected attribute analysis

 - Recommendation auditing

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
### 1. Data Imbalance

1005 "general" vs 1-5 samples for specific products

Solution: Implemented SMOTE + BalancedRandomForest

### 2. Cold Start Problem

New customers with minimal history

Solution: Fallback to demographic-based rules

### 3. Feature Integration

Combining tabular data with text embeddings

Solution: Custom pipeline with dimension alignment

### 4. Real-time Performance

Transformer model latency

Solution: Caching + pre-computed embeddings
